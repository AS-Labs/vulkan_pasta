Vulkan Renderer

This is a simple C code for creating a Vulkan instance and initializing some Vulkan objects for a basic renderer. The code sets up a Vulkan instance with application information, including the application name, version, engine name, and version. It also defines the window dimensions, swap chain images, swap chain image views, swap chain format, and swap chain extent.
Prerequisites

This code assumes that the Vulkan SDK is installed on the system and that the necessary Vulkan headers are included in the include path for compilation.
Usage

To use this code, you can include it in your Vulkan renderer project and call the createInstance() function to create a Vulkan instance with the specified application information. The function checks for the success of the instance creation and exits with an error message if it fails.
Dependencies

This code relies on the following libraries and headers:

    stdio.h: for standard input/output operations.
    stdlib.h: for general-purpose functions, such as memory allocation and process control.
    vulkan/vulkan.h: for Vulkan API functions and data types.
